    <h1>FRAMES AND FRAMESETS</h1>
    <h3>WHAT ARE FRAMES ?</h3>
    <p>HTML frames are used to divide your browser window into multiple sections where each section can load a separate
        HTML document. A collection of frames in the browser window is known as a frameset. The window is divided into
        frames in a similar way the tables are organized: into rows and columns.</p>
    <h3>HOW TO CREATE A FRAME ?</h3>
    <p>To use frames on a page we use <b>&ltframeset&gt</b> tag instead of <b>&ltbody&gt</b> tag. The
        <b>&ltframeset&gt</b> tag defines, how to divide the window into frames. The rows attribute of
        <b>&ltframeset&gt</b> tag defines horizontal frames and cols attribute defines vertical frames. Each frame is
        indicated by <b>&ltframe&gt</b> tag and it defines which HTML document shall open into the frame.
    </p>
    <h3>ATTRIBUTES OF THE &ltframe&gt TAG</h3>
    <p>Here are some attributes and their description of the &ltframe&gt tag:</p>
    <p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li><b>src</b><br>This attribute is used to give the file name that should be loaded in the frame. Its
            value can be any URL. For example, src = "/html/top_frame.htm" will load an HTML file available in html
            directory.</li>
        <li><b>name</b><br>This attribute allows you to give a name to a frame. It is used to indicate which
            frame a document should be loaded into. This is especially important when you want to create links in one
            frame that load pages into an another frame, in which case the second frame needs a name to identify itself
            as the target of the link.</li>
        <li><b>frameborder</b><br>This attribute specifies whether or not the borders of that frame are shown; it
            overrides the value given in the frameborder attribute on the &ltframeset&gt tag if one is given, and this
            can take values either 1 (yes) or 0 (no).</li>
        <li><b>marginwidth</b><br>This attribute allows you to specify the width of the space between the left
            and right of the frame's borders and the frame's content. The value is given in pixels. For example
            marginwidth = "10".</li>
        <li><b>marginheight</b><br>This attribute allows you to specify the height of the space between the top
            and bottom of the frame's borders and its contents. The value is given in pixels. For example marginheight =
            "10".</li>
        <li><b>noresize</b><br>By default, you can resize any frame by clicking and dragging on the borders of a
            frame. The noresize attribute prevents a user from being able to resize the frame. For example noresize =
            "noresize".</li>
        <li><b>scrolling</b><br>This attribute controls the appearance of the scrollbars that appear on the
            frame. This takes values either "yes", "no" or "auto". For example scrolling = "no" means it should not have
            scroll bars.</li>
        <li><b>longdesc</b><br>This attribute allows you to provide a link to another page containing a long
            description of the contents of the frame. For example longdesc = "framedescription.htm"</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>ATTRIBUTES OF THE &ltframeset&gt TAG</h3>
    <p>Here are some attributes and their description of the &ltframeset&gt tag:</p>
    <p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li><b>cols</b>
            <br>Specifies how many columns are contained in the frameset and the size of each column. You can specify
            the width of each column in one of the four ways -

            Absolute values in pixels. For example, to create three vertical frames, use cols = "100, 500, 100".

            A percentage of the browser window. For example, to create three vertical frames, use cols = "10%, 80%,
            10%".

            Using a wildcard symbol. For example, to create three vertical frames, use cols = "10%, *, 10%". In this
            case wildcard takes remainder of the window.

            As relative widths of the browser window. For example, to create three vertical frames, use cols = "3*, 2*,
            1*". This is an alternative to percentages. You can use relative widths of the browser window. Here the
            window is divided into sixths: the first column takes up half of the window, the second takes one third, and
            the third takes one sixth.
        </li>
        <li><b>rows</b><br>This attribute works just like the cols attribute and takes the same values, but it is
            used to specify the rows in the frameset. For example, to create two horizontal frames, use rows = "10%,
            90%". You can specify the height of each row in the same way as explained above for columns.</li>
        <li><b>border</b><br>This attribute specifies the width of the border of each frame in pixels. For
            example, border = "5". A value of zero means no border.</li>
        <li><b>frameborder</b><br>This attribute specifies whether a three-dimensional border should be displayed
            between frames. This attribute takes value either 1 (yes) or 0 (no). For example frameborder = "0" specifies
            no border.</li>
        <li><b>framespacing</b><br>This attribute specifies the amount of space between frames in a frameset.
            This can take any integer value. For example framespacing = "10" means there should be 10 pixels spacing
            between each frames.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>DISADVANTAGES OF FRAMES</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Some smaller devices cannot cope with frames often because their screen is not big enough to be divided up.
        </li>
        <li>Sometimes your page will be displayed differently on different computers due to different screen resolution.
        </li>
        <li>The browser's back button might not work as the user hopes.</li>
        <li>There are still few browsers that do not support frame technology.</li>
    </ol>
