    <h1>FORMS</h1>
    <p>
        &ltform&gt is a HTML element to collect input data with containing interactive controls. It provides facilities
        to input
        text, number, values, email, password, and control fields such as checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons,
        etc., or in other words, form is a container that contains input elements like text, email, number, radio
        buttons, checkboxes, submit buttons, etc. Forms are generally used when you want to collect data from the user.
        For example, a user wants to buy a bag online, so he/she has to first enter their shipping address in the
        address form and then add their payment details in the payment form to place an order.

        Forms are created by placing input fields within paragraphs, preformatted text, lists and tables. This gives
        considerable flexibility in designing the layout of forms. </p>
