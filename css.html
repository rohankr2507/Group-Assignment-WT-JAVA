    <h1>CASCADING STYLE SHEETS</h1>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the look and
        formatting of HTML and other structured documents. With CSS, designers and developers
        can separate the presentation of a web page from its content, making it easier to maintain
        and modify. CSS allows you to define styles for text, font, color, background, layout,
        and more, and apply those styles to specific elements or groups of elements. By using CSS,
        you can create visually appealing and consistent designs across multiple pages or even an
        entire website. CSS is an essential tool for modern web development, and its use has become
        standard practice in the industry.

    </p>
    <h3>TYPES OF CSS</h3>
    <p>There are three types of CSS:
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Inline</li>
        <li>Internal</li>
        <li>External</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h4>INLINE CSS</h4>
    <p>
        Inline CSS is a type of CSS that is applied directly to an HTML element using the "style"
        attribute. This attribute allows you to add style rules directly to an individual HTML element,
        such as a paragraph or heading. Inline CSS has the highest specificity of all CSS types, meaning
        that it takes precedence over.Inline CSS is typically used for small, quick style changes, such
        as changing the color or font size of a single word or phrase. It is not recommended to use
        inline CSS extensively, as it can make the HTML code difficult to read and maintain. Instead,
        it is recommended to use external or internal CSS for larger, more complex style changes.

    </p>
    <h4>INTERNAL CSS</h4>
    <p>
        Internal CSS is a way to add style rules directly to an HTML document using the "style"
        tag within the "head" section of the HTML file. This allows you to define specific styles
        for individual elements on the page, without affecting other pages on your website.
        Internal CSS is a popular option for smaller websites and projects, as it allows you to keep
        your HTML and CSS in the same file. This can make it easier to maintain your code and make
        changes quickly, especially if you are not familiar with CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less.
    </p>
    <h4>EXTERNAL CSS</h4>
    <p>External CSS is a way to separate the presentation (style) of a website from its content (HTML).
        In this approach, the CSS rules are written in a separate file with a ".css" extension, which is
        linked to the HTML document using the "link" tag.
        External CSS has several benefits over internal CSS or inline styles. Firstly, it makes it easier
        to maintain and update your website's design, as all of the style rules are stored in one file
        that can be updated independently of the HTML content. This can also make it easier to collaborate
        with other designers or developers, as the CSS file can be shared and updated independently of the
        HTML files.</p>
